				<h4>A brief history of rice:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>2800 B.C</strong>: First documented account of decree on rice planting authorized by Chinese emperor</li>
					<li><strong>1685</strong>: Rice first introduced to the Americas via Charles Towne harbor by a storm-battered ship in need of repairs</li>
					<li><strong>1700</strong>: Rice becomes a major crop of the Carolinas and Georgian colonies. Nearly 300 tons of American Rice is exported to England</li>
					<li><strong>1726</strong>: Port of Charleston is exporting nearly 4500 metric tons of rice annually until the colnoies gain their independence 50 years later.</li>
					<li><strong>1849</strong>: The gold rush led to the immigration of over 40,000 Chinese workers whose main staple of food was rice. Rice production rose in areas like California.</li>
					<li><strong>1884</strong>: A mechanized revolution took place in the United States that made producing rice easier and more profitable</li>
					<li><strong>Present Day</strong>: Improvements in technology allows the United States to become one of the top rice exporters in the world. Nearly 90 percent of the rice consumed in the United States is produced within its own borders.</li>
